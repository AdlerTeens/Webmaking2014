<h2>About Me</h2>
<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>I went to high school in St. Louis. In high school I was did band, softball, and an afterschool club about economics. During my last couple years of high school, I got to work at a bank doing web site updates for their company. It was my first time using HTML and Javascript, and I really liked how much like a puzzle it was.</p>
<p>After high school, I went to Syracuse University for music education. I started working for a science summer camp in the summers though, so moved to California and started working at a science center. Last December I moved to Chicago to work at the Adler.</p>
