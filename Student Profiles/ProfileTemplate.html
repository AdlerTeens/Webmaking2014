    <p>This is your part of the site to play around with! Use this page to let us know who you are, but you can build more pages under your folder to be whatever you want!
    We're going to use this site as a place to test things and play around with new codes that we learn.</p>

    <h2>My Picture</h2>
    <p>Post a picture here, either of yourself or something that represents you!</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Where I'm From</h3>
    <p>Add in a couple paragraphs about what you like, where you go to school, anything you want us to know about you.</p>

    <h2>Where I go to school</h2>
    <p>Post the picture of your school that you found earlier.</p>

    <h2>My Playlist</h2>
    <p>Set up another web page under your folder that lets us know some songs you'd like to add to our class playlist.
    If you can't think of any music, you can let us know your goals for the web-making workshops.
    Make sure to link to the page somewhere here!</p>
